# HTML5 Layout

** The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google. **

# HOW javascript makes web bages more interactive :
** Select the text inside all of the elements on a page
Select any elements that have a c1ass attribute with a value of note
Find out what was entered into atext input whose id attribute has avalue of emai1 **
# What is a script and how do I creat one :
** A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. **

# write a script we need :
** define the goal (the task ) we want to achieve
design the script by split the goal into series of task
code each step by writen them into programming langaue that
computer understand with javascrip **
 # Attributes
 ** Some tags may also include an attribute, which is additional information that is included only within the start tag. Attributes are specific to each tag, although there are many similarities. Some tags must have an attribute to function properly. An example of an attribute is shown in the first paragraph tag shown in the example above (<p align="center">.) The web standards suggests that all attribute parameters be contained within quotes. For example, it is not correct to have this: <p align=center> **
