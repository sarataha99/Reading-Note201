 # Layout
HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

 # HTML Layout Elements
header - Defines a header for a document or a section.
nav - Defines a set of navigation links.
section - Defines a section in a document.
article - Defines an independent, self-contained content.
aside - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)

# HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

The HTML < a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

< a href=”url”>link text< /a>

The most important attribute of the < a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link’s destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
