# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.


# Tables
 table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results

 # Table Headings
The th element is used just like the td element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.) Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a td or th element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly. (The first cell in the first row of this example shows an empty cell.)

# CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS
The object is created on the first line of the code sample. The properties and methods are then added to it afterwards. Once you have created an object, the syntax for adding or removing any properties and methods from that object is the same.


# JavaScript
we can use the new keyword and the object constructor to create a blank object

we can update the value of properties using the dot notation or square brackets

# Storing Data
In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize the data, we can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key
A variable has just one key (the variable name) and one value
Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.

# Property Attributes
All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.

The value is one of the propertyâ€™s attributes.

Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.

These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)

In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable

# Build in Object
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

JavaScript has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts
